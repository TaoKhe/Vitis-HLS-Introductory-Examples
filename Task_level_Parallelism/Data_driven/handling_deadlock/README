This example shows how to debug a data-driven task-level parallelsim model that deadlocks when
running C simulation.

Running the Design (edit run_hls.tcl to set $hls_exec and enable specific run steps)
=========================================================
vitis-run --mode hls --tcl run_hls.tcl

Steps to debug the resulting deadlock error that is reported by csim_design command:
====================================================================================
[1] Open Vitis HLS GUI (vitis_hls -p proj)
[2] In the Flow Navigator Window, Click on "Run C Simulation" link
[3] In the window (titled "C Simulation Dialog") that pops up, select 
    the "Launch Debugger" option and click "OK".
[4] The debugging process is currently stopped in the main() function. Click on 
    the "Resume" icon (Top Left-most Green Triangle Icon) to continue the simulation.
[5] Click "Resume" causes the simulation to run and you will see the 
    "deadlock detected when simulating hls::tasks" in the Console window.  
[6] In the Debug window, you can see all the task Threads that are Suspended state. 
    Step into each thread and select the line in the user code to see where each 
    thread is stalled. Look for the function names to identify each thread. 
[7] Stepping through the threads, you will see two tasks t3_1 and t3_2 
    (usually Thread #5 and #6 but this could be different on your machine but
    both running function func3) stuck reading their input streams.
