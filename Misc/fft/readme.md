Description
===========

This C++ design illustrates the use of the AMD/Xilinx FFT LogiCORE IP in Vitis HLS. This example is a single 1024 point forward FFT.

The architecture is using dataflow with 3 processes : 
* a datamover to read the input data,
* a process to call the FFT itself,
* a datamover to write-out the output data. 


```

     |                                                                       |

     |                                                                       |
     +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

The FFT C++ instantiation supports two access modes for "in" and "out": via arrays or via hls::stream<>.
In these two variants, the top level function arguments (the input "in" and output "out") use the same data types as internally. 

The 2 variations of the design are referenced in the table below. If you integrate the FFT into a dataflow region you may not need the datamovers.


|   Design name    | Top level interfaces | Internal data types |
|:----------------:|:--------------------:|:-------------------:|
| interface_array  |         array        |         array       |
| interface_stream |        stream        |        stream       |

The design example has been tested with version 2025.1 of Vitis HLS.

Design Files
============
Each design variations has the following files:

data        : directory with input and expected data used by the testbench
fft_tb.cpp  : C testbench; calls 20 times the top function
fft_top.cpp : top C function fft_top
ffp_top.h   : header file for the example 
run_hls.tcl : script to run synthesis, simulation and export IP
run.py	    : script to run csimulation, csynthesis and cosimulation using vitis
README      : a small readme file which refers to this readme.md

Running the Example
===================
Open a command prompt with vitis tools set up, go into the directory of a given design example and then run the command : 
```
$ vitis_hls -f run_hls.tcl
```
If you wish you can open the project with the VHLS GUI :
```
$ vitis_hls -p proj_*
```
Run python script with vitis
```
$ vitis -s run.py
```
To open the HLS component in Vitis Unified IDE after running the python script:
```
$ vitis -w w
```


Performance
===========

## Throughput
After running the design example, you can check the throughput in the GUI by opening the co-simulation report and verifying the II numbers for the top-level function fft_top which will be in the range 1025 - 1027 clock cycles which is expected for the 1024 point FFT; you can also open the waveform if you enabled the dump trace option.
On the command line you can grep the output of the latency report, for example 
```
$ for d in interface_* ; do echo $d ; grep THROUGHPUT $d/proj*/solution1/sim/report/verilog/lat.rpt ; done
interface_array
$MAX_THROUGHPUT = "1027"
$MIN_THROUGHPUT = "1027"
$AVER_THROUGHPUT = "1027"
interface_stream
$MAX_THROUGHPUT = "1025"
$MIN_THROUGHPUT = "1025"
$AVER_THROUGHPUT = "1025"
```

## Frequency
In terms of achievable frequency, the design example is setup in Vitis HLS for 3.3 ns (i.e. 300 MHz) targetting a U200 Alveo board (part xcvu9p-flga2104-2-i); Using the export flow, we can check what frequency is achieved when run with the out-of-context implementation option. 
Different frequencies will be achieved if you change the target part and/or the clock period or, the design.

Points to Note 
===============
You will see:
- in the tcl script setup: -start_fifo_depth 4 is used,
- a wrapper around the fft call is sometimes used to improve the performance.

We are aiming the remove the above 2 restrictions.
